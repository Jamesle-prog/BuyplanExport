"""House cleanup for cut-plan output — the post-process the cutting room expects.

This replaces the Excel macro that was run by hand on every cut plan
(``cleanCuttingPlanOutput`` = ``translate`` + ``RemovePathAndExtension``):

* English labels become the Chinese the cutting room reads.
* Marker cells arrive as full Windows paths from the marker software
  (``D:\\Markers\\SS26\\ABC-1234.mrk``); only the marker name is wanted.

Both passes run over **every** cell, exactly as the macro did — the labels are
not the only thing that needs it, since marker paths live in data cells.

Faithfulness notes (the macro's behaviour is deliberately preserved):

* Replacements are **case-insensitive substring** matches (``LookAt:=xlPart``),
  so ``"Marker Length,cm"`` becomes ``"版长,cm"`` and ``"N Markers"`` becomes
  ``"N 版s"``. That is what the macro produced and what the cutting room is
  used to reading.
* Order matters and is preserved: ``Marker Length`` and ``Marker Ratio`` must
  be replaced **before** the bare ``Marker`` rule, or the short rule would
  consume the prefix and the specific labels would never match.
* Every replacement is Chinese and every search term is ASCII, so no rule can
  re-match an earlier rule's output — the sequence cannot cascade.
